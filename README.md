## Passionate Web developer since 1999

My favourite backend stack these days:

 - **Python**  
 - **[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)** - to me, a really sweet spot between "clean code" (whatever that means :sweat_smile:) and rapid application development :ok_hand:
 - **Postgres** _(thanks to [this book](https://theartofpostgresql.com/) â™¥)_
 - **Redis**
 - **GraphQL**

During the last few years I've also worked with **[Go](https://go.dev/)**, as well as **TypeScript & [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**.

In the past I've worked with **Symfony**, **Zend Framework**, **Node.js**, **Ruby On Rails**, **Backbone.js**... and even 10 years of **Flash** development in the good ol' days :smile: :joystick:
