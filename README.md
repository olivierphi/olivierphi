## Passionate Web developer since 1999

My main stack nowadays is "Python+[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)", and it's the one I'm the most productive with :slightly_smiling_face: - 
but in the last few years I've also worked with "TypeScript+[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)" and [Go](https://go.dev/).

In the past my main tools were "PHP+Symfony", JavaScript... and Flash in the good ol' days :smile: :joystick:
